# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: instead of repeating this.state, it uses {} = this.state

  Researched answer:It's a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: array, value, index

  Researched answer: The current item.The current index.The array you called filter on



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: class is a blueprint of an object and the object holds properties of key:value pair

  Researched answer: A class is simply a blueprint of an object which we are going to create. So it contains properties and methods that an object is going to have. object is simply an instance of the class.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: div wraps larger block of code and a span holds the smaller block of code

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: It lives in return() below render(). something that you need to render the page with the component you want?

  Researched answer: React fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM because fragments are not rendered to the DOM. So basically we use React. Fragment where we would normally use a wrapper div.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: bootstrap,?,?...

  Researched answer:
1.Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
2.Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
3.Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming:Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- irb:An institutional review board (IRB), also known as an independent ethics committee (IEC), ethical review board (ERB), or research ethics board (REB), is a type of committee that applies research ethics by reviewing the methods proposed for research to ensure that they are ethical. ????

- Instance variable: An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data. We say that objects can: Do things.
- Ruby hash:A hash is a data structure that stores items by associated keys. This is contrasted against arrays, which store items by an ordered index. Entries in a hash are often referred to as key-value pairs. This creates an associative representation of data.
- Class relationships:Three important relationships in Ruby are known as ‘belongs to…’, ‘has many…’, and “has many of each other”. The ‘belongs to’ and ‘has many’ relationships are considered to be the inverse of one another.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby: these methods allow us to access a class’s instance variable from outside the class. Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
